# Glitch-FX-Processing-Version
A Processing version of my Glitch-FX sketch with extra features
<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  This is a version of my Glitch-FX sketch on Open Processing done fully with original (Java) Processing 3.
  <br><br>
  This version also comes with the ability to load your own images as well as saving your own creations!
</p>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Press <b>'G'</b> to generate a new effect on the image.</li>
  <li>Press <b>'S'</b> to save as .jpg (NOTE: when saving just type a file name <b>without</b> the extension)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Effects Included</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Scramble</li>
  <li>Scanlines</li>
  <li>Warp</li>
  <li>Pixel Burn</li>
  <li>Noisy</li>
  <li>Scanner</li>
  <li>Jpg Degrade</li>
  <li><b>More will be planned in the very near future</b></li>
</ul>
<h2>Future Development</h2>
<p>As of the latest version, any image will only be loaded as a <b>fixed 1000 x 1000px size</b>. I may try to find some method of allowing variable sizes/aspect ratios depending on the input image (with the settings() function), but for now, the size remains fixed.
